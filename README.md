## API Environments

| Environment| Base URL
|---|---|
| Production| https://api.pomelopay.com/public              

## Authentication

Our system uses a `client_id` an `client_secret` for API authentication.

You can create new third party applications using your merchant portal.
A new `client_id` and `client_secret` (API Key) will be issued immediately. 

If you are performing direct HTTP requests to the API it sufficient to specific the API Key in the header.

| Header| Content
|---|---|
| Authorization | `api_key    ` 

If you are using a SDK or other libraries it is usually required to specify both the application id `(client_id)` and API key `(client_secret)`.


| SDK| Example
|---|---|
| PHP | `$client = new Client('apikey', 'appid');`


## Pagination

For list views the results will be paginated.
The envelop for the results is as follows:

```
{
  "count": 100 // total count of all items,
  "items": [{...},{...}] // array of returned items
}
```

The first page parameter if you do not set it explicitely will be 1.

| queryString| Example
|---|---|
| page | `?page=2`

## Errors

We use both error messages and HTTP status codes. The error message envelop is as follows:

```
{
  "code": "PP-xx-xx" // error code,
  "message": "Transaction not found" // readable message explaining the error
}
```

| HTTP status code| Description
|---|---|
| 400 | Bad request, check input parameters

### 🌐 Webhooks

#### Receive and process webhooks

Please see the webhook section for more information

## Verifying data integrity

On sending a transaction you must on application side create a signature with your api key.

On receiving webhooks it is strongly recommended to calculate the signature on your side and compare it with the specified signature to ensure data integrity.

The calculation of the signature is as follows:

| Signature method | Data |
|---|---|
| md5 | md5('amount=2000&currency=GBP&apiKey=mysecretkey').digest('base64')
| sha1| sha1('amount=2000&currency=GBP&apiKey=mysecretkey').digest('hex')

## Webhooks

Our system uses webhooks to receive **real-time notifications** about any transaction state changes. The webhooks are using the `POST` http method.

It is strongly recommended to check the **signature** from the transaction and validate it to ensure the data is coming from an authentic source.

Alternatively you can also specify a custom URL for a single specific transaction. 

> For more information about verifying data integrity you can check the Verifing Data Integrity section. 

### Setting your webhook URL

- Navigate to [https://dashboard.pomelopay.com](https://dashboard.pomelopay.com)
- Login with your merchant account
- From the left-hand side menu select "Connect"
- From the secondary navigation select "Webhooks"

- The specified URL should be a publicly accessible endpoint that accepts `POST` data in `JSON` format
